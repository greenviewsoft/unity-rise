- Level 2: 8% = $80.00
- Level 3: 7% = $70.00
- Level 4: 6% = $60.00
- Level 5: 5% = $50.00
- Level 6: 4% = $40.00
- Level 7: 3% = $30.00
- Level 8: 2% = $20.00
- Level 9: 1% = $10.00
- Level 10: 1% = $10.00

**Total Commission**: $470.00 (47% of investment)

## System Health Checks

- ✅ All investments generate commissions
- ✅ Commission calculations are accurate
- ✅ Rank rewards are processed correctly
- ✅ User balances are updated properly
- ✅ Referral relationships are maintained

## Production Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration**: Ensure all migrations are run
2. **Seeder Data**: Remove test data before production
3. **Commission Service**: Verify service is properly integrated
4. **Admin Access**: Set up proper admin authentication
5. **Performance**: Monitor commission processing performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Commissions**: Check referral chain integrity
2. **Incorrect Amounts**: Verify rank and level calculations
3. **Performance Issues**: Consider queue processing for large volumes
4. **Data Integrity**: Regular database consistency checks

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check user referral chain
php artisan tinker
>>> User::find(1)->getReferralChain()

# Verify commission calculation
>>> $service = new App\Services\ReferralCommissionService();
>>> $service->calculateCommission(1000, 6, 1);
```

## Support

For any issues or questions regarding the referral commission system:
